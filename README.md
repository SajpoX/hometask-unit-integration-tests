# hometask-unit-integration-tests
## Description
Simple project which presents my work in unit tests and integration tests hometask during Automation QA Bootcamp in Evolution.

## Usage
To run the project the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) enviroment is required.

## Running the tests
- run the command `npm install` in the root path of the repository package.
- run the command `npm test` in the root path of the repository package.

## Conclusion
Some of the tests resulted with fail. It is caused by testing the results when the negative input is provided. The logic of the script can be discussed and proper input validations can be added to the main script file `rectangle.js`.
